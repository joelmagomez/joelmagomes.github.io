    <h1><strong>SEVEN</strong></h1>
    <p>Weight of the world on your shoulders
        I'll kiss your waist and ease your mind
        I must be favored to know ya
        I'll take my hands and trace your lines</p>
    <p>
        It's the way that we can ride, it's the way that we can ride (oh-oh, oh-oh)
Think I met you in another life, so break me off another time (oh-oh, oh-oh)
You wrap around me and you give me life
And that's why night after night, I'll be lovin' you right
    </p>
    <p>
        Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday (a week)

You know night after night, I'll be lovin' you right, seven days a week
    </p>
    <p>
        You love when I jump right in, all of me, I'm offering
Show you what devotion is, deeper than the ocean is
Wind it back, I'll take it slow, leave you with that afterglow
Show you what devotion is, deeper than the ocean is
    </p>

        Tightly take control, tightly take his soul
Take your phone and put it in the camera roll
Leave them clothes at the door
Watchu waitin' for? Better come and hit yo' goals
Uh, he jump in it, both feet
Goin' 'til the sun up, we ain't gettin' no sleep
Seven days a week, seven different sheets
Seven different angles, I could be your fantasy
    </p>
    <p>
        Open up, say, "Ah"
Come here, baby, let me swallow yo' pride
What you on? I can match your vibe
Hit me up and I'ma Cha Cha Slide
You make Mondays feel like weekends
I make him never think 'bout cheatin' (uh)
Got you skippin' work and meetings
Let's sleep in, yeah (seven days a week, ooh)
